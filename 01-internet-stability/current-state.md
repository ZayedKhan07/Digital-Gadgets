# Current State: Internet

## Location

Muhaisnah 4, Dubai, UAE

## What I Have

- Wireless connection only
- ~25 Mbps download (on a good day)
- Upload speed: unknown, likely worse
- Drops during video calls
- Latency spikes during remote access

## Problems

- Can't rely on it for remote work calls
- AnyDesk/remote desktop unusable at times
- Large file transfers fail or crawl
- No wired ethernet to my workspace
- Need ethernet cables to establish wired connection

## What I Don't Know Yet

- [ ] Actual upload speed
- [ ] Whether my building has fiber available (Muhaisnah 4 area)
- [ ] Which ISPs serve my building (Etisalat / du coverage)
- [ ] If I can get ethernet to my desk (wall ports? cabling needed?)
