# Next Actions: Internet

## Immediate

1. **Run speed test** - Check actual upload speed and latency
2. **Check fiber availability** - Contact building management or Etisalat/du for Muhaisnah 4 coverage
3. **Inspect workspace** - Is there an ethernet port? Distance to router?
4. **Get ethernet cables** - Buy Cat6 cables (measure length needed first)

## Ethernet Cable Notes

- Looking for ethernet cables for wired connectivity
- Need to measure: router to desk distance
- Cat6 recommended (handles gigabit, future-proof)
- Buy from local electronics store or order online (Amazon.ae, Noon, etc.)

## Decisions Needed

| Question | Options | My Call |
|----------|---------|---------|
| ISP choice | Etisalat / du | TBD after checking availability |
| Wired connection method | Wall port / long cable / mesh + backhaul | TBD after inspecting space |
| Speed tier | 100 Mbps / 250 Mbps / 500 Mbps | TBD based on plans offered |

## Blockers

- Can't proceed with anything else until I know fiber is possible
- If no wired option, need to explore mesh/powerline as backup

## Done

- (nothing yet)
