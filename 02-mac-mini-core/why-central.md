# Why Mac mini M4 is Central

## The Decision

Mac mini M4 is the core of my dev workflow. This is not optional, not future, not "nice to have."

## Why Mac

- Native macOS dev tools (Xcode, iOS simulators if needed)
- Apple Silicon performance for local AI/ML tasks
- Unix-based environment (better for dev tooling)
- Stable, low-power always-on machine
- Claude Code and modern dev tools run great on it

## Why Not Just Use Windows Laptops

- Windows laptops = client/browsing/meetings devices
- Mac mini = where the real dev work happens
- Separation keeps things clean

## Role of Mac mini in My Setup

```
[Windows Laptops] ---> [Mac mini M4] ---> [Dev work, builds, AI tools]
     (clients)           (compute core)
```

- Primary: Sit at desk, work directly on Mac mini
- Secondary: Remote in via AnyDesk when away from desk
