# Budget Setup: 500 AED

Target: Get a working Mac mini workstation for ~500 AED total.

## The Reality

500 AED is tight. New monitors alone cost 400-700 AED. To hit this budget:
- Go second-hand for monitor
- Buy budget new keyboard + mouse
- Skip desk upgrade (use dining table)

---

## Option A: Second-Hand Monitor + New Peripherals

| Item | Source | Price (AED) |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Monitor 22-24" (used) | Dubizzle / FB Marketplace | 100 - 200 |
| Logitech K380 keyboard | Amazon.ae / Noon | 150 - 180 |
| Logitech Pebble mouse | Amazon.ae / Noon | 80 - 100 |
| **Total** | | **330 - 480** |

**Where to find used monitors:**
- Dubizzle.com → Electronics → Monitors
- Facebook Marketplace Dubai
- Search: "monitor 24 inch" or "Dell monitor" or "LG monitor"

**Tips for buying used:**
- Ask for photos of screen (check for dead pixels)
- Test before paying if possible
- Dell and LG hold up well used

---

## Option B: Use TV as Monitor + New Peripherals

If you have a TV with HDMI:

| Item | Source | Price (AED) |
|------|--------|-------------|
| TV (already own) | - | 0 |
| Logitech K380 keyboard | Amazon.ae / Noon | 150 - 180 |
| Logitech Pebble mouse | Amazon.ae / Noon | 80 - 100 |
| HDMI cable (if needed) | Amazon.ae | 20 - 40 |
| **Total** | | **250 - 320** |

**Note:** TV works but not ideal for long coding sessions (text can be blurry, size awkward). Good as temporary solution.

---

## Option C: All New, Absolute Minimum

Cheapest new items:

| Item | Model | Source | Price (AED) |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Monitor 21.5" 1080p | Samsung/LG basic | Carrefour / Lulu | 300 - 400 |
| Keyboard | Generic USB | Carrefour / Dragon Mart | 30 - 50 |
| Mouse | Generic USB | Carrefour / Dragon Mart | 20 - 40 |
| **Total** | | **350 - 490** |

**Tradeoff:** Generic keyboard won't have Mac layout (Cmd key will be labeled Win). Works, but awkward.

## My Recommendation for 500 AED

**Go with Option A + Cables + Cable Management:**

| Item | Specific Choice | Est. Price |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Monitor | Used Dell 24" 1080p from Dubizzle | ~150 AED |
| Keyboard | Logitech K380 for Mac (new) | ~170 AED |
| Mouse | Logitech Pebble M350 (new) | ~90 AED |
| HDMI cable | 2m basic | ~25 AED |
| Ethernet cable | Cat6 5m (for future) | ~25 AED |
| Cable management | Clips + velcro ties | ~30 AED |
| **Total** | | **~490 AED** |

This gets you:
- Decent screen to work on
- Mac-compatible keyboard (proper Cmd key layout)
- Quiet, reliable mouse
- All cables needed to connect everything
- Clean desk with cable management
- Ethernet ready for when you need wired connection

## Cables Required

### Mac mini to Monitor

| Cable | When You Need It | Price (AED) |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **HDMI cable** | Most monitors have HDMI input, Mac mini has HDMI out | 20 - 40 |
| USB-C to HDMI | If you want to use Mac mini's USB-C port instead | 40 - 80 |
| USB-C to USB-C | Only if monitor has USB-C input (unlikely for budget monitors) | 50 - 100 |

**Recommendation:** Just get a basic HDMI cable. Mac mini M4 has an HDMI port, most monitors have HDMI input. Simple.

**Length:** 1.5m - 2m is enough for desk setup.

### Ethernet Cable (For Future Use)

| Cable | Spec | Length | Price (AED) |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| **Cat6 Ethernet** | Gigabit capable | 5m | 20 - 35 |
| **Cat6 Ethernet** | Gigabit capable | 10m | 30 - 50 |
| **Cat6 Flat** | Runs under doors/rugs | 10m | 40 - 60 |

**Recommendation:** Get a 5m or 10m Cat6 cable now. Even if using WiFi, good to have for:
- Connecting Mac mini directly to mesh node
- Testing wired vs wireless speeds
- Backup when WiFi acts up

### Mesh System Cables

If you get a mesh system (e.g., TP-Link Deco):
- **Power cables:** Included with mesh units
- **Ethernet (optional):** Connect main mesh unit to router via ethernet for best performance
- **No special cables needed** - mesh units talk to each other wirelessly

---

## Cable Management

Keep your desk clean and cables organized.

| Item | Purpose | Price (AED) |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Cable clips (adhesive)** | Stick to desk edge, hold cables in place | 10 - 20 |
| **Cable sleeve/wrap** | Bundle multiple cables together | 15 - 30 |
| **Cable box** | Hide power strip and excess cables | 30 - 50 |
| **Velcro cable ties** | Reusable ties to bundle cables | 10 - 20 |
| **Under-desk cable tray** | Mount under desk, holds everything | 50 - 100 |

### Budget Cable Management (~40 AED)

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| Adhesive cable clips (pack) | ~15 AED |
| Velcro ties (pack) | ~15 AED |
| Cable sleeve 1m | ~10 AED |
| **Total** | **~40 AED** |

**Where to buy:** Amazon.ae, Noon, Daiso, IKEA (FIXA cable management)

## What You're Giving Up at This Budget

| Compromise | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| 1080p instead of 4K | Text less sharp, but workable |
| 22-24" instead of 27" | Less screen space, but fine for single tasks |
| No USB-C monitor | Use HDMI from Mac mini |
| Used monitor | Might have minor wear, but functional |

---

## Upgrade Path Later

Once budget allows:
1. **First upgrade:** New 27" 4K monitor (~1,200+ AED)
2. **Keep:** K380 and Pebble work fine long-term
3. **Eventually:** Better keyboard (Keychron) and mouse (MX Master)
