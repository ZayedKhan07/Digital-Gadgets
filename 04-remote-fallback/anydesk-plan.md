# Remote Access Fallback: AnyDesk

## When I Use This

- **Only when** I can't be at my desk physically
- **Not** as the primary way to use Mac mini
- Travel, different room, temporary situations

## Why AnyDesk

- Works cross-platform (Windows → Mac)
- Good performance when internet is stable
- Unattended access possible
- Free tier sufficient for personal use

## Limitations (Be Realistic)

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Depends on internet quality | Unusable if connection drops |
| Latency | Noticeable delay, annoying for coding |
| Resolution | May not match local experience |
| Multi-monitor | Limited support |
| File transfer | Slower than local |

## Setup Requirements

**On Mac mini:**
- AnyDesk installed
- Unattended access enabled
- Strong password set
- Mac mini always on and connected to internet

**On Windows laptops:**
- AnyDesk installed
- Mac mini added to address book

## Expectations

- This is a **backup**, not daily driver
- If I'm using AnyDesk daily, something is wrong with my setup
- Goal: minimize remote access dependency by having a proper local workspace

## Current Status

- [ ] AnyDesk installed on Mac mini
- [ ] Unattended access configured
- [ ] Tested from Windows laptop
- [ ] Performance acceptable (depends on internet - see 01-internet-stability)
