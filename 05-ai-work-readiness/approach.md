# Approach: AI-Assisted Product Building

## The Philosophy

```
Traditional dev:    Learn → Code → Build → Ship
My approach:        Idea → AI builds → I guide → Ship
```

## My Stack

### Core (What I Use Daily)

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| **Claude Code** | Primary AI assistant - writes code, fixes bugs, explains things |
| **Google IDX** | Cloud IDE - dev environment without local setup hassle |
| **Rive** | Animations - make products look and feel good |

### Learning (Not Mastering)

| Topic | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **JavaScript concepts** | Understand what Claude Code writes, guide it better |
| **Basic web concepts** | HTML, CSS basics to communicate with AI effectively |

## How I Work

1. **Have an idea** - what do I want to build?
2. **Describe to Claude Code** - explain what I need
3. **AI writes code** - Claude generates it
4. **I review and guide** - ask for changes, fixes
5. **Use IDX to run/test** - see it work
6. **Add Rive animations** - polish the product
7. **Ship it**

## What Makes This Work

- Stable internet (for cloud IDE, AI APIs)
- Mac mini as reliable workstation
- Good monitor to see code + preview + animation tool side by side

## What I Don't Need

- Local Python ML setup
- Docker/containers
- Complex dev tooling
- Deep programming knowledge
