# My Daily Workflow

## The Loop

```
Idea → Claude Code → IDX → Test → Rive (if needed) → Ship
```

## Typical Session

1. **Open IDX** - cloud environment ready
2. **Open Claude Code** - AI assistant ready
3. **Describe what I want** - "Build me a landing page with..."
4. **Claude writes code** - copy to IDX or let Claude edit directly
5. **Preview in IDX** - see if it works
6. **Iterate** - "Change the button to...", "Fix this error..."
7. **Add animations** - Rive for polish
8. **Deploy** - push to Vercel/Netlify

## What I Need From My Setup

| Need | Why |
|------|-----|
| Stable internet | IDX is cloud-based, Claude needs API |
| Good monitor | See code + preview + Rive side by side |
| Mac mini | Reliable machine, always ready |
| Keyboard/mouse | Comfortable for long sessions |

## When Things Go Wrong

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Code doesn't work | Ask Claude to fix it, paste the error |
| Don't understand something | Ask Claude to explain in simple terms |
| Animation won't integrate | Check Rive docs, ask Claude for help |
| Internet drops | Can't work - this is why 01-internet is priority |

## What I'm Getting Better At

- [ ] Describing what I want clearly to AI
- [ ] Basic JavaScript concepts
- [ ] Knowing when code looks wrong (even if I can't fix it myself)
- [ ] Rive animation skills
- [ ] Shipping finished products
