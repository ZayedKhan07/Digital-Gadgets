# AI Work Readiness: Overview

## Goal

Build apps and products using AI tools - not become a software engineer.

## My Approach

- **AI does the heavy lifting** - Claude Code, IDX handle the code
- **I direct and decide** - product thinking, design, what to build
- **Learn enough to guide** - JavaScript concepts, not mastery
- **Ship things** - apps, products, real output

## Current Workflow

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Google IDX | Cloud IDE, development environment |
| Claude Code | AI coding assistant, writes code for me |
| Rive | Animations for apps/products |

## What I'm NOT Doing

- Becoming a Python expert
- Learning to code from scratch the traditional way
- Deep ML/AI model training
- DevOps or infrastructure engineering

## What I AM Doing

- Building apps and products
- Using AI to write and fix code
- Learning JavaScript concepts (enough to understand and guide)
- Focusing on output, not expertise
