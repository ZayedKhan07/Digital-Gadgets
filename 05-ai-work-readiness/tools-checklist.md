## What I Can Skip

- [ ] ~~Python setup~~ - not my focus
- [ ] ~~Docker~~ - overkill for my workflow
- [ ] ~~Local LLMs~~ - cloud AI is fine
- [ ] ~~Complex build tools~~ - IDX handles this

## Deployment (When Ready to Ship)

- [ ] Vercel account (easiest for web apps)
- [ ] Or Netlify
- [ ] Custom domain (optional)
