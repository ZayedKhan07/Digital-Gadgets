# My Tech Setup Workspace

Personal execution workspace for building apps and products with AI.

## My Workflow

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Claude Code | AI writes the code |
| Google IDX | Cloud IDE to run and test |
| Rive | Animations for polish |

**Philosophy:** I'm not becoming a software engineer. I'm using AI to build things.

## Current Pain Points

1. **Internet is broken** - Wireless ~25 Mbps, drops during calls, can't trust it for remote work
2. **No proper workstation** - Using laptops without monitors, no standardized peripherals
3. **Mac mini M4 not yet integrated** - Core of my dev workflow, needs to be set up properly

## Priority Order

| Priority | Blocker | Why First |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| 01 | Internet stability | Everything else depends on reliable connection (need ethernet cables) |
| 02 | Mac mini M4 setup | Core development machine, non-negotiable |
| 03 | Workspace hardware | Monitors, keyboard, mouse for daily work |
| 04 | Remote fallback | AnyDesk only if local Mac unavailable |
| 05 | AI work readiness | End goal: build apps/products with Claude Code + IDX + Rive |

## How I Use This Repo

- Each folder = one blocker to solve
- Numbers = execution order
- Inside each folder: current state → target → next action
- Update as I make progress
- Not for others to read, for me to execute

## Current Assets

- 3x Windows 11 laptops (16GB RAM, SSD)
- Location: Muhaisnah 4, Dubai, UAE

## What's NOT Tracked Here

- Costs and budgets
- Long-term wishlist items
- Theory or tutorials
